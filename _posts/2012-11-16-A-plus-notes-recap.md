As stated in previous post, last weekend I attended Evernote Hackathon Brasil. After reading some
support on Evernote Brasil [Facebook page \(*in Portuguese*\)](https://www.facebook.com/EvernoteBR),
I definitely will finish it and publish on Google Play. I don't know yet if I'll keep it free, but in
case I go for paid version, it won't be expensive. Maybe I'll go with a freemium version or lite vs paid.
Also, probably after Android I'll port it to iOS.

Since this is a side project and I have a business to run, development will be slow. So, to prevent
people from thinking development has stalled, whenever I do something on the app, I'll write at least
a small post. Stay tuned.
