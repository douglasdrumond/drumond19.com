Since a hackathon is very time limited, we sketched a UI with the bare minimum
to get it done in time for presentation. Therefore, it was really rough and
poorly designed and now it's time for a complete redesign.

I don't care how much trouble I'll have later to code it, I'll try my best to
make it simple for our users. The side effect is I'll get better at coding, so,
why not?

To finish up this brief post, I'll tell about the tools: I'm using Pixelmator
and iDraw.  Most of the time, I'm going with iDraw, but I guess I'll need
Pixelmator to draw some textures.
