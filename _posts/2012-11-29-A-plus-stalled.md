I'm very sorry to say, A+ Noted development stalled. I'm in a critical
phase in my company, so I'm totally focused on it. This week has been
very tiresome and next one will be too. Also, this week I had to prepare
my talk for [DevFest Brasil](http://www.devfest.com.br), I had
no time to work on A+ Notes. I even missed English and karate classes.

In two weeks development should normalize (by that, I mean [SNAFU](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=snafu)), since 
the development is slow).
